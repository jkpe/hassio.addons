## About

This is a very hacky setup of Cloudflare argo that helps people access their Home Assistant and other HassOS addons via a public URL.

Cloudflare Argo uses a tunnel and therefore bypasses any need for a NAT'd public IP (LTE connections) or opening firewall ports etc.

## CONFIG

The basic config enables 1 Cloudflare Argo tunnel using:
certificate ( sign-up via https://www.cloudflare.com/a/warp upload to /config and put the path here )
cf-cred ( set a /config based path here ,the file will generate itself)
hostname
service

The addon supports 3 tunnels using the additional configuration values:
hostname2
service2

hostname3
service3


When you leave hostname2 and 3 blank they will not be compiled into settings

You'll need to sign up for Argo with Cloudflare directly and generate an SSL certificate at the following url:
https://www.cloudflare.com/a/warp

## Multiple Domains
Currently for this new version of Argo multiple domains are not supported.

## Still more to do :(
With the new version of Cloudflare they also want you to configure a domain name via the UI.

To do this you'll need to create a CNAME pointing to your <Tunnel ID>.cfargotunnel.com

To find your funnel ID check the logs for:
Starting tunnel tunnelID=<ID>
